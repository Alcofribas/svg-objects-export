Export SVG elements to other formats (png, pdf, ps, eps, svg), selecting them  based on their ID with regular expressions.


usage
-----
svg-objects-export.py [-h] [-p PATTERN] [options] infiles


arguments
---------

**positional arguments:**

    infiles              SVG file(s) to export objects from, wildcards are
                         supported

**optional arguments:**

    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    -p PATTERN, --pattern PATTERN
                          pattern (regular expression) to identify which objects
                          to export or exclude from export (depending on
                          --exclude). Default pattern matches most ID generated
                          automatically by Inkscape (in exclude mode).
    -e, --exclude         use pattern to determine which objects to exclude from
                          export, instead of include
    -d DESTDIR, --destdir DESTDIR
                          directory where images are exported to. default is
                          working directory
    -s, --silent          do not print information to command line
    -f, --force           do not prevent existing files from being overwritten
    -i INKSCAPE, --inkscape INKSCAPE
                          path to inkscape command line executable
    -t {png,ps,eps,pdf,plain-svg}, --type {png,ps,eps,pdf,plain-svg}
                          export type (and suffix). png by default. See Inkscape
                          --help for supported formats (png, ps, eps, pdf,
                          plain-svg).
    -x Inkscape_Export_Options, --extra Inkscape_Export_Options
                          Extra options passed through (litterally) to inkscape
                          for export. See Inkscape --help for more.

requirements
------------
This program requires Inkscape 0.48+ and Python 2.7+

default behaviour
-----------------
The program exports by default all objects with an ID that has not
been generated automatically by Inkscape.

If you provide a custom pattern (-p), then exclude (-e) is by default
turned off, that is: your custom pattern is used to define wich objects
are *included* unless you specify -e.

examples
--------
    svg-objects-export.py --pattern '^export' in.svg

exports all objects with an ID starting with 'export' from in.svg
to PNG files in the current directory.

    svg-objects-export.py --silent --force --type eps --destdir vector/  ~/*.svg ~/tmp/*.svg

exports all objects with an ID that does not ressemble Inkscape
default IDs, from any SVG file in user's home and tmp directories,
to ./vector/ directory as EPS files, with no information displayed and
overwritting existing files

    svg-objects-export.py --exclude --pattern '[0-9]' --extra '--export-dpi 900' in.svg

exports all objects with an ID containing no digit, from in.svg file,
as PNG images with a resolution for rasterization of 900 dpi. As 
Inkscape uses 90 by default, this results in 10-times bigger images.
